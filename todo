--[[ Protonova's Todo:
* Add opactiy to LoS/OoR conditions to frame.
* Fix Slash Commands
    > Switch for manabars.

    > Switch for configuration menu.
* Add optional healer stats LDB
* Add Ability to switch between percent and exact HP deficit to Units.
* Intoduce new textures via style.lua once completed.
* Add localizations.
* Modify how frames are displayed in terms of layers as well as how D/C, Porting, Has aggro, and selected (bar too thick) are displayed.
* Redesign the specs buttons, add tooltip ability to grab spec name from talent panel. (Maybe, I still don't like that bar)
* Add segmented HoT indicator for SS.
* Add a timer bar for HoTs (Max 3 trackable HoTs).
* Figure out how to replace Role icons with something none intrusive.
* Add 2 modes. Normal and None intrusive mode where mouse clicks just dont register other than left click. (For mouseover only users).
