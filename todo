--TODO:
--mana bar support (with events only in combat and with events + periodic update out of combat), see manabar.lua
    for details
--separate main frame elements in separate files (like manabar.lua,healthbar.lua, etc)
--move buffs/debuffs related functions into the buffmonitor.lua and move the file into frmelements folder
--move castbar.lua into frmelements folder


--[[ Protonova's Todo:
* Add opactiy to LoS/OoR conditions to frame.
* Fix Slash Commands
    > Switch for manabars.
    > Switch for dragger.
    > Switch for profiling. Possibly save layout per spec instead of overall profile.
    > Switch for /help.
    > Switch for configuration menu.
* Add optional healer stats LDB
* Add Ability to switch between percent and exact HP deficit to Units.
* Intoduce new textures via style.lua once completed.
* Add localizations.
* Modify how frames are displayed in terms of layers as well as how D/C, Porting, Has aggro, and selected (bar too thick) are displayed.
* Redesign the specs buttons, add tooltip ability to grab spec name from talent panel. (Maybe, I still don't like that bar)
* Add segmented HoT indicator for SS.
* Add a timer bar for HoTs (Max 4 trackable HoTs). Ideally for SS, HS, HC, HF. Originally thought 3, 4 might be too intrusive.
* Figure out how to replace Role icons with something none intrusive.
* Add 2 modes. Normal and None intrusive mode where mouse clicks just dont register other than left click. (For mouseover only users).
