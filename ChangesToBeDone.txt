When entering frame, highlight it. Make the hovered frame lighter.
Remove the bar on top. Nvm It actually disappears in combat. Change the Icons imo.
Make it so if I hold down alt while my mouse is hovering over RaidHBot that a black bar at the bottom pops up so I can move stuff around.
Remove Role Icon. 
replace percents with actual deficit hp.
Vertically Center text.
Make the white bar around the frame when frame is selected smaller...
Make the aggro dection be actually aggro detection per target. Not just a combat detector. Nvm it does do as said.
Add the healer stats LDB.
Add the segmented HoTs.
Add ability to detect stacks on both hots and debuffs. NVM It does this but kinda buggy
Add localizations?
Ability to track hots via a hots overlay type status bar. Like a timer cast bar. from right to left.
Use new texture that doesn't have rounded corners.
Somehow remove the dragger on the side, add a /slash cmd for it
Make a Minimap icon or LDB.
Manabars!!!
Oh The spec names can be added to the LDB. It can automatically grab names from specs.

Redo how the mouse binds work. Make them like VuhDo. Don't make users have to put in modifers.
Add new mode where it doesn't take any mouse clicks. Just frames.
in 1.8 ability to tell if something is actually Los from you.

Bugs:
Orbs stack numbers don't actually update.
/rhb doesnt work lol

Talk to ZorbaTHut about:
Ability to detect modifiers when clicking. So that I can tell the difference between M5 and shift+M5
Ability to envoke right click functionality.
Abilty to accept keybinds? O.o
